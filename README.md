# CreateM3U

Why not just "dir *.mp3 /b > !playlist.m3u"?
Because it can't deal with German umlauts.

Note: 
The code for the individual playlist names was written with such a folder structure in mind:

<pre>
Artist
  Album Name
</pre>
or
<pre>
Artist
  Album Name
    Disc 1
</pre>
or
<pre>
Album Name
</pre>
or 
<pre>
Album Name
  Disc 1
</pre>
