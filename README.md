# CreateM3U

Why not just
<pre>dir *.mp3 /b > !playlist.m3u
</pre>? Because it can't deal with German umlauts.<br/>
<br/>
Note: <br/>
The code for the individual playlist names was written with such a folder structure in mind:<br/>
<pre>
Artist
  Album Name
</pre>
or
<pre>
Artist
  Album Name
    Disc 1
</pre>
or
<pre>
Album Name
</pre>
or 
<pre>
Album Name
  Disc 1
</pre>
